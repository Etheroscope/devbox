# Devbox

## Mac

Before running the scripts make sure:
 1. Your current directory is the *devbox root*.
 2. Devbox is in the *same directory* as other etheroscope repos.

To setup your macOS computer for development for the Etheroscope project, run `./macos/setup` (if that fails, run `chmod +x macos` and try again), grab a coffee, sit back and wait for everything to be done for you.

The script will:
  - Install: `brew`, `git`, `elixir`, `npm` and `docker` (if they are missing)
  - Build & run development servers for:
    - etheroscope_ex
    - etheroscope_js

## Windows

Not implemented yet :/
